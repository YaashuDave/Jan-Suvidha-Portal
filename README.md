# Jan-Suvidha-Portal
The Idea:
-->Our Project Idea was a Jan Suvidha Portal, where citizens can seek information about various government schemes and beneficiaries can know about various documents required and the procedures for availing benefits of Government schemes.

Solution:
-->Every time citizens need to fill in their information repeatedly for getting benefits of various schemes so we built a centralized portal that can store citizens' basic information based on that beneficiaries can know about applicable schemes relevant to him/her and can apply accordingly.
-->On the other hand, Government officials can also analyze citizens' data who have applied for the schemes and facilitate.

Technologies used:
-->HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, and Python.

Impact our portal created:
-->Citizens' will become more empowered by the schemes.
-->Citizens' can access schemes related to multiple sectors like agriculture, health, education, etc. from a single portal.
-->Citizens can get maximized benefits from various government schemes with minimum effort. Government can analyze patterns and based on that can identify citizens' requirements.
